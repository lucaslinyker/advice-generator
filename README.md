## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [BEM](https://getbem.com/) - For arquiteture CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to use the fetch API to get data from an external API. I also learned how to handle errors.

Below you can see the code:

```js
try {
    const response = await fetch(apiURL);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Error ${response.status} in the request!`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    codeAdvice.innerText = data.slip.id;
    textAdvice.innerText = `"${data.slip.advice}"`;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    codeAdvice.innerText = error.message;
    textAdvice.innerText = "Try again!";
    codeAdvice.style.color = "red"
    textAdvice.style.color = "red"
  }
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about the fetch API and how to handle errors. I also want to learn more about the async/await and promises.

### Useful resources

- [Fetch api Mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) - This helped me to understand how to use the fetch API.
